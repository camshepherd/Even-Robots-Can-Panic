## Background
You play as one of the two maintennance robots on a spaceship travelling to a far-off destination. Your ship is travelling through an asteroid field and your pilot is quarantined off and not very good for that matter! You need to keep the ship moving long enough for you to reach your home of Alpha Centauri and find someone competent to pilot you...
